# üêö Minishell  
>_As beautiful as a shell_

Minishell is a small recreation of 'bash' written from scratch in C. This was a group project with my teammate Mariia as part of the 42 curriculum. It supports many core features found in standard Unix shells, such as pipes, redirections, environment variables, and built-in commands.

The goal was to better understand how shells work under the hood by building one ourselves ‚Äî from input parsing to process management.
